## Burst ARM tools
Burst miners and plotters cross-compiled to ARM processors for GNU/Linux.

ATTENTION, I DO NOT ALREADY CHECKED IF THE BINARIES WORK CORRECTLY.

If you have any problem, contact me via email or bitcointalk.

Howto: Clone the repository to your ARM system, extract it, and execute like:

> For Uray miner:

> ./burstminer

> For Dcct miner:

> ./mine32

TODO:
- Compile to ARMv7 only, for supporting dual core and other better instructions.
- Testing and benchmarking the compilations.
- Check if any board is not supported.

NOTE: DCCT Tools and Uray miner are not writted by me, this is just a port to ARM boards, all rights for these developers.
