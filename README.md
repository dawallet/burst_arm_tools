# burst_arm_tools
Burst miners and plotters cross-compiled to ARM processors for GNU/Linux.

  ATTENTION, I DO NOT ALREADY CHECKED IF THE BINARIES WORK CORRECTLY.
  
  If you have any problem, contact me via email or bitcointalk.

Howto:
  Clone the repository to your ARM system, extract it, and execute like:
  
  
  For Uray miner:
  
  ./burstminer
  
  or for Dcct miner:
  
  ./mine32

TODO:
  - Compile to ARMv7 only, for supporting dual core and others instructions.
  - Testing and benchmarking the compilations.
  - Check if any board is not supported.

DCCT Tools and Uray miner are not writted by me, this is just a port to ARM boards, all rights for these developers.
